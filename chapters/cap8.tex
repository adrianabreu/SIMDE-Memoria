\section{Summary}
\label{8:sec:1}

With the development of this work we have now available a new versi√≥n of
the Instruction Level Paralelism's simulator SIMDE.

It has been demonstrated that the diversity of tools and techologies available today (such as 
the new languages for the web, the webcomponents and the building tools), make possible
to develop and design with realitve easiness complex applications.

It is important to remember that as in every software development, the develop of 
a program is a process that is alive, being able to suffer changes, and since the 
exhausting rythm that the web world is following, maybe this work will be no more
that a little footn note at what it may be able to become.

\section{Future work lines}
\label{8:sec:2}

After the development of this work, there are many future lines open: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Implementation of the Very Long Instruction Word machine: This can not be a surprise. Based on the
 initial design, the application is ready for evolve and get the same capabilities that original simulator.
 This line has the highest priority of all.

\item Make more test: In the web world is not easy to test for the multiple cases that can be presented,
but this application is really focused on its core logic. Making it a great candidate for being tested. 
There are a few test donde based on Ava, the futuristic test runner for typescript. Making more and 
more concrete test would make of SIMDE a great and robust software.

\item Integrate exercises with the application: SIMDE is an educational tool. And since it is web based, 
it would be possible to design an environment where the application could interact with another app, 
making it easier for autonomous students.

\item Implement a standard state management system: Right now, the application uses a handmade tool for
management the states and allow time travelling. There are many options available but all of them requires
a deep knowledge of the tool, which stays out of the amount of work of this project. In my opinion, the best 
tool for this job would be Mobx, instead of Redux. Since it is object oriented and requires less boilerplate code.
